            <h1>Paisley's Final Project!</h1>
            <p1>
            For my final project I decided to make an interactive art piece with lights and motors that react to real-world inputs. The art piece I used for this project is a portrait of Senora Sabasa Garcia by 19th century artist Francisco Goya, which I salvaged from the trash in high school.

            <h3> Concept: Interactive Art Piece </h3>
            <p>
            To the left is my original concept sketch. I had many ideas for possible interactions, which are listed next to the sketch. I ranked the interactions from what I thought was most important for my project to least important, and decided my plan would be to go down the list, completing as many interactions as I could before the dealine. I was able to complete the first three interactions: LEDs Reacting to Thermoster, Light Strip Reacting to Photoresistor, and Joystick Controlling Servo Motor.

            LEDs Reacting to Thermistor
            </h3>
            <p>
                For this interaction, I wired 6 white, red, yellow, green, and blue LEDs that would light up depending on reading by the thermistor. Allow t to be the reading given by the resistor, if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>t < 645 = white, red, yellow, green, blue on HIGH</li>
                <li>645 <= t < 655 = red, yellow, green, blue on HIGH; white on LOW</li>  
                <li>655 <= t < 665 = yellow, green, blue on HIGH; white, red on LOW</li>  
                <li>665 <= t < 675 = green, blue on HIGH; white, red, yellow on LOW</li>  
                <li>t > 675 = blue on HIGH; white, red, yellow, green on LOW</li>  
            </ul>
            <p>
                For all the lights I used 220 ohm resistors because it is higher than the minimum required resistance for these LEDs when connected to the Arduino Uno. For the thermistor I used a 330 ohm resistor because it did not matter what kind of resistor I used (so long as I used one) and the 330 ohm resistor was the one I happened to pick up.

            Here is the schematic for LEDs and thermistor.

            <h3>
            Here is my math for how I chose the proper resistances to use. I chose to use 220 ohms of resistence for the GPIO LED, and 10 kohms of resistence for the 
              photoreceptor. The photoreceptor would work just fine with a lower resistance, but a higher resistance saves energy. As the resistance of the photoreceptor
              translates to the LED being either red or blue, the exact amount of resistance doesn't matter.
